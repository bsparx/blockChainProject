# Blockhain Assignment

## The repo contains the following files:

#### Auction.sol for requirement one. 
#### IERC20.sol, IERC20Metadata.sol, ERC20.sol, MyERC20.sol and ICO.sol for requirement two.

#### The IERC20, IERC20Metadata and ERC20 contracts are provided by OpenZeppelin.
#### The MyERC20 contract inherits from the ERC20 and calls on internal functions.
#### The ISO contract connects to the MyERC20 token through its address to allow the coin offering functionality

#### To fulfill requirement two, both the contracts were launched on Sepolia testnet. Here are their adresses:
#### MyERC20.sol : 0x030Ec433D1D33647CA6F1dcF5E96088E9F36a771
#### ICO.sol : 0x9ee633295B3927dCE716dCeefca9378a5047D837
